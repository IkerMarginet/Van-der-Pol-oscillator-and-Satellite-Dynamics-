# Van-der-Pol-oscillator-and-Satellite-Dynamics-
Numerical resolution of ODEs in MATLAB using Euler, Heun, and ode23. Includes Van der Pol oscillator and satellite motion simulations (with and without lunar influence). Focus on phase portraits, energy conservation, and method accuracy. Report and code included.
