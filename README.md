# Numerical Simulation of Differential Equations with MATLAB

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a numerical study of differential equations using MATLAB, applied to two distinct dynamic systems:

1. **The Van der Pol Oscillator** – investigation of nonlinear oscillations for various initial conditions and damping parameters (ε).
2. **Satellite Orbital Dynamics** – simulation of a satellite orbiting the Earth under gravitational influence, including an extension with lunar perturbation.

The numerical methods implemented are:
- **Euler's method**
- **Heun's method**
- MATLAB's built-in solver **`ode23`**

Analyses include phase portraits, error estimation, energy conservation, and the impact of varying parameters on system behavior.

> 🗒️ **Note**: The accompanying report is written in **French**.

## 🔄 Execution Order

To run the simulations, follow this order:

### Van der Pol Oscillator

Simulate the Van der Pol oscillator and analyze errors:

```matlab
run('src/vanderpol/vanderpol_main.m')
```

*  No dependencies required.

---

### Satellite Simulations

#### 1. Simulate Satellite Orbits

```matlab
run('src/satellite/simulation_satellite.m')
```

* 📎 Requires: `m_heun_vecto.m`

#### 2. Analyze Satellite Energy

Run this **after** `simulation_satellite.m` to analyze the system's energy:

```matlab
run('src/satellite/calcul_energie.m')
```

* 📎 Requires:

  * `calculer_energie.m`
  * Variables generated by `simulation_satellite.m`

#### 3. Simulate Satellite and Moon Trajectories

This script can be run **independently** to simulate satellite and Moon paths:

```matlab
run('src/satellite/satellite_lune.m')
```

* 📎 Requires: `m_heun_vecto.m`
